# SO2 Memory Management Simulation ðŸš€

This repository contains several Python scripts that simulate various memory management schemes often used in operating systems. The projects illustrated here include examples on paging, fixed partitioning, and variable partitioning. ðŸ’»

## Overview
- **examenPagina.py**: Simulates page table management for processes, including page allocation and freeing up physical memory.
- **mejorA.py**: Implements a best-fit memory allocation strategy using partitions, with a pending jobs queue and internal/external fragmentation reporting.
- **particion_fija.py**: Demonstrates fixed partition allocation where jobs are assigned to memory partitions, with dynamic job release and reassignment.
- **prueba1.py**: Another example of partition-based job allocation with fragmentation tracking.
- **variableA.py**: Illustrates variable partition allocation by scanning a continuous memory space and assigning processes accordingly.

## How to Run ðŸ”§
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LILE-Z/SO2.git
   cd SO2
   ```
2. Run the desired Python script. For example, to run the paging simulation:
   ```bash
   python examenPagina.py
   ```
